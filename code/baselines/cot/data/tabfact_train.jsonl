According to the table, Port Harcourt is indeed an LGA with Port Harcourt as its administrative capital. Second, we need to check the population of Port Harcourt as per the 2006 census. The table shows that the population of Port Harcourt in 2006 was 541,115. To determine if this population is larger than 425,208.9417698913, we compare the two numbers. Since 541,115 is larger than 425,208.9417698913, the population of Port Harcourt in 2006 exceeds the given number. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n### END"}

According to the table, the drivers who completed more than 56 laps are Jackie Stewart, François Cevert, Emerson Fittipaldi, Andrea De Adamich, Niki Lauda, Chris Amon, Denny Hulme, and Carlos Pace. Second, we need to calculate the average grid position for these drivers. The grid positions for these drivers are 6, 4, 9, 18, 14, 15, 2, and 8 respectively. The sum of these grid positions is 76. The average grid position is calculated by dividing the sum of the grid positions by the number of drivers, which is 76 divided by 8, resulting in an average of 9.5. Therefore, the statement that the average grid for drivers who completed more than 56 laps is 5 is not true. The answer is no.\n\n### END"}

The number of seats for the MCI buses placed in service in 1987 is 45, and for those placed in service in 1996/1997 is 57. Second, to determine if MCI has the least amount of seats, we compare the number of seats in MCI buses (45 and 57) to the number of seats in other buses. There are buses with fewer seats than MCI, such as the GM Advanced Design bus in 1983 with 41 seats and the TMC bus in 1990 with 39 seats. Therefore, MCI does not have the least amount of seats. Also, the quantity of MCI buses is not the least in the table. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n### END"}

These are on October 12 - 14, 2007, with a sample size of 472, and on November 9 - 11, 2007, with a sample size of 506. Second, we need to check who the Democratic candidate was in these instances. In both cases, Hillary Clinton is listed as the Democratic candidate. Therefore, the statement in the question that Hillary Clinton was not the Democratic candidate when Mike Huckabee was the Republican candidate and the sample size was less than 495 is not true. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n### END"}

According to the table, Per Gustafsson, a player from Sweden, was picked by the Florida Panthers. Second, since the direct question is whether Per Gustafsson played for the Calgary Flames, and the table explicitly shows that he was picked by the Florida Panthers, not the Calgary Flames, the data contradicts the statement made in the question. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n### END"}
