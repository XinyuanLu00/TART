The table shows that for Gonorrhea, which is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the traditional antimicrobial therapy includes Penicillin and Tetracycline. However, the table also shows a resistance prevalence of 20%a90% for Penicillin and 0%a46% for Tetracycline, indicating that these antibiotics may not always be effective due to resistance.

The ingredient \"Thimerosal\" is listed with the purpose \"To prevent contamination,\" which aligns with the question's statement about it being a preservative used to prevent contamination. Similarly, \"Neomycin\" is also listed with the purpose \"To prevent contamination by bacteria during the vaccine manufacturing process.\" The table also mentions that \"Antibiotics that people are most likely to be allergic to like penicillin aren't used in vaccines,\" which suggests that Neomycin is unlikely to cause allergies. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n### END"}
