The condition with the highest prevalence rate is \"Hypertension (all ages)\" with a rate of 13.8 (13.8 to 13.8), not \"Epilepsy (18+)\" which has a prevalence rate of 0.8 (0.8 to 0.8). Therefore, the answer is no."

    "question": "Is it true that Risk factor for those with HIV infection for TB was less than 10?",
    "gold": "yes",
    "explanation": "To answer this question, we need to look at the table provided, which lists various risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) and their relative risks. The relative risk for active TB disease in individuals with HIV infection is listed as 8.3 (with a range of 6.1 to 10.8). This means that people with HIV infection are 8.3 times more likely to develop active TB disease compared to those without HIV infection. Since the question asks if the risk factor is less than 10, and 8.3 is indeed less than 10, the answer is yes."
