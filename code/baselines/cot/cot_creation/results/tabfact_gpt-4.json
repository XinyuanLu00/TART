    "question": "Is it true that mci has the least amount of seats and a quantity of 32?",
    "gold": "no",
    "explanation": "To answer this question, first, we need to locate the specific data for MCI in the provided table. According to the table, MCI was placed in service in 1987 and 1996/1997, with quantities of 21 and 32 respectively. The number of seats for the MCI buses placed in service in 1987 is 45, and for those placed in service in 1996/1997 is 57. Second, to determine if MCI has the least amount of seats, we compare the number of seats in MCI buses (45 and 57) to the number of seats in other buses. There are buses with fewer seats than MCI, such as the GM Advanced Design bus in 1983 with 41 seats and the TMC bus in 1990 with 39 seats. Therefore, MCI does not have the least amount of seats. Also, the quantity of MCI buses is not the least in the table. Therefore, the answer is no."
