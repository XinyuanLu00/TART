Question: Is it true that The models using BoC outperform models using BoW as well as ASM features?
'''

To answer the question of whether models using Bag of Concepts (BoC) outperform those using Bag of Words (BoW) as well as Abstract Syntax Markup (ASM) features, we first examine the F1 scores from the provided table. For BoC (Wiki-PubMed-PMC) and BoC (GloVe), the F1 scores range between 0.91 and 0.93 across Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. These scores are consistently equal to or higher than those for BoW, which are between 0.91 and 0.93, and significantly higher than the scores for ASM, which range from 0.88 to 0.89 across all model types. The consistency in higher or equal performance metrics for BoC compared to BoW, and the clear advantage over ASM, indicate that models using BoC indeed offer superior or equivalent performance. Therefore, the answer is yes.

|| OD (no polarity shifters) | JS div. | 0.09 | -0.01 | -0.02 ||
|| OD (no polarity shifters) | EMD | 0.10 | 0.01 | -0.01 ||

Question: Is it true that OD significantly outperforms OD-parse: We observe that compared to OD-parse, OD is much more accurate?
'''

To answer the question of whether OD significantly outperforms OD-parse in terms of accuracy, we examine the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) scores provided in the table for different opinion topics and distance functions, including Absolute, JS divergence, and Earth Moverâ€™s Distance (EMD). For the Absolute difference function, OD posts ARI scores of 0.54, 0.56, and 0.41 for Seanad Abolition, Video Games, and Pornography, respectively, which are markedly higher than those of OD-parse, which records scores of 0.01, -0.01, and 0.07. Similarly, under the EMD function, OD scores of 0.26, -0.01, and 0.01 also surpass those of OD-parse, which are 0.07, 0.01, and -0.01. Even under the JS divergence function, where both methods show lower scores, OD still manages equal or slightly better performance. This consistent pattern across all topics and distance measures clearly demonstrates that OD outperforms OD-parse, particularly under the Absolute and EMD functions, confirming that OD is indeed much more accurate. Therefore, the answer is yes.
